    <p>Born a crime explains how apartheid in South Africa separated the 
      country into two tribes the Zuluand the Xhosa.There was warfare 
      among these two tribes . The fierce Zulu tribe were wiped out after 
      they resisted European invaders. On the other hand, the Xhosa people
      made an effort to absorb lessonsfrom the Europeans and used strategy
      rather than force to repel their invasion. When apartheid ended,
      the two tribes' growing resentment turned into a battle. Trevor 
      Noah's mother, was of Xhosa desc.
      Trevor Noah narrates a story about the history, customs, and culture 
      of his own nation during theyears just prior to and following the end 
      of apartheid.Trevor's mother was a devoted Christian who took her family 
      to several churches every Sunday, despite the fact that native South Africans 
      had been forced to convert to Christianity by European settlers.
  </p>
    <p>Every church had  a certain racial demographic—primarily Black, mostly 
       White, or mixed—and offered something unique. Trevor loved going to church,
       but he didn't enjoy the commute to these churches.When the family's used
       vehicle broke down in the mornings, they would have to take different 
       minibusses. Trevor's mother had unshakable trust in God and was never 
       easily intimidated.When Trevor was nine years old, his mother received 
       threatening remarks from a bus driverwho accused her of being a prostitute 
       and condemning her for traveling with a stranger  .</p>
    <p>Trevor was born into a family of Black parents and White fathers amid the legal
       prohibition of interracial marriage during the apartheid era.
